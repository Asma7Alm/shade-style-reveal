# **TrueHue: AI-Powered Colour Analysis Tool

TrueHue is an AI tool that analyses a person’s skin tone, hair, and eye colour from a photo to suggest a personalised colour palette — for example, which exact shades of blue, red, or green suit them best.

## 🌟 Why TrueHue?

- Discover their best-suited colours for clothing and personal style.
